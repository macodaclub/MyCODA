        <b>The MaCODA initiative</b> was launched in September 2019 in the context of the <a

            target="_blank">MaCODA Workshop</a>, organized by the
        Lorentz Center at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), University of Leiden.

        This initiative aims to develop and disseminate a community-led research agenda for many-criteria
        optimization, by promoting discussion and creating a research agenda for a step-change in the understanding
        of many-criteria optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many-criteria problems occur in multidisciplinary engineering design (e.g. urban planning, drug discovery,
        transportation), in such problems a large number of potentially conflicting objectives need to be optimized.
        Traditional multi-objective optimization methods work only on problems with a very small number of
        objectives. Due to their high dimensionality, the problems with a larger number of objective functions,
        so-called many-objective problems, differ not only quantitatively but also qualitatively in their
        characteristics from problems with smaller numbers of objectives.<br/>
        Such problems pose new challenges for algorithm design, preference elicitation and modeling, visualisation
        and implementation.
